## 2. State of the art

### i. Dialog Generation and Action Detection

#### a. State-of-the-art technologies : 

> Deploy a model for each technology. The main technologies are the following :
>	- Watson Knowledge Studio 
>   - Alexa Skills Kit 
>   - Google's DialogFlow
> 
> All these technologies offer a free limited account.

#### b. Dialog Generation and Action Detection in Deep Learning :

> Explain the state-of-the-art of Dialog Generation and Action Detection in deep learning literature. 

### ii. Word Representation

> Explain Word Representation models in Deep Learning and train them on spoken French data. The models of the state-of-the-art are :
>	- FastText (2017)
>	- GloVe (2015)
>	- Word2Vec (2013)
>	- ELMo (2018) - arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365

## 3. Text Data

### i. Getting data using Web Scraping

> For this section, we need to :
>	- Scrape Text data from a list of pre-defined sources (example : Lamanche data)
>	- Do a volumetric analysis on data


### ii. Production and comparison of Word Representation models

> In this part : 
>	- we reproduce the state-of-the-art models for Word Representation on the scraped data
>	- we compare the Word Representation models

## 4. A Dialog Generation and Action Detection mixed architecture

### i. An overview of a proposed solution

### ii. Implementation and results

## 5. Perspectives

> In this chapter, we proposed more ideas for future work on this project. 

## 6. Conclusion
> A brief resume on the work during the project period, the achieved results and the future advances that might be applied to improve our solution.
